## Introduction
IMPL() macro should be added for each HLS function so that the hls_tools can identify and automatic generate additional functions for capturing data / perform co-simulation. Additional, several memory interfaces are provided for HLS functions to share the data with RISC-V. They are XMEM, DCACHE and APCALL arguments.

### XMEM
XMEM is a shared memory region used to share small and frequently accessed variables between HLS functions and RISC-V.

### DCACHE
The DCACHE interface can allow HLS to access the DDR memory transparently. Access times can vary depending on the cache miss rate and are generally slower than those of the XMEM variables.

### APCALL argument
You can choose to pass the arguments using the apcall argument. The significant limitation include: support for input type only, a maximum of 8 arguments and a maximum width of 32 bits im each argument. Generally, use the XMEM region is a better way to share data between HLS and RISC-V.

### Example:
```C

struct pos{
    int x   _ALIGN;
    int y   _ALIGN;
};

typedef struct {
    int xm_x            _ALIGN;
    int xm_y            _ALIGN;
    int xm_arr[5]       _ALIGN;
    int *xm_ptr         _ALIGN;
    struct pos xm_pos   _ALIGN;
}xmem_t;

//1. It is recommended to add the xm_ prefix to distinguish the variable from XMEM and APCALL arguments
//2. _ALIGN macro should be added to each variable
//3. Regardless of the _i and _o postfix naming generated by Vitis HLS

int IMPL(fa_hls)(int xm_a, int xm_b, int xm_arr[5], int *xm_ptr, struct pos xm_pos, int c, DCACHE_ARG(uint8_t, buf, 1024), uint32_t dcache[DCACHE_SIZE]);
