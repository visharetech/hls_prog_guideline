## 5. HLS Arguments
XMEM, DCACHE and APCALL arguments could be used to share the variable between riscv and these HLS functions.

### 5.1 XMEM
XMEM is a shared memory region used to share small and frequently accessed variables between HLS functions and RISC-V.

### 5.2 DCACHE
The DCACHE interface can allow HLS to access the DDR memory transparently. Access times can vary depending on the cache miss rate and are generally slower than those of the XMEM variables.

### 5.3 APCALL argument
You can choose to pass the arguments using the apcall argument. The significant limitation include: support for input type only, a maximum of 8 arguments and a maximum width of 32 bits im each argument. Generally, use the XMEM region is a better way to share data between HLS and RISC-V.

### Example:
```C

typedef struct {
    int x   _ALIGN;
    int y   _ALIGN;
}vector_2d;

typedef struct xmem_t{
    uint8_t xor_val8                                 _ALIGN;
    uint16_t xor_val16                               _ALIGN;
    uint32_t xor_val32                               _ALIGN;
    int arr_complete[5]                              _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_s1                                 _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_s2                                 _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_d1                                 _ALIGN;
    int tc_arr[2]                                    _ALIGN;
    uint8_t no_p_arr[2]                              _ALIGN;
    uint8_t no_q_arr[2]                              _ALIGN;

    int arr_s1[10]                                   _ALIGN;
    int arr_s2[10]                                   _ALIGN;
    int arr_d1[10]                                   _ALIGN;
    uint8_t pix_base[128*128]                        _ALIGN;
}xmem_t;
```

1. It is recommended to add the xm_ prefix to distinguish the variable from XMEM and APCALL arguments
2. _ALIGN macro should be added to each variable
3. The _i and _o postfixes generated by the HLS function are ignored. In other words, vec_i, vec_o, vec are treated as the same variable.

The argument not in the XMEM will be treated as APCALL argument. Therefore, if the argument is declared as an array and is not declared in XMEM, during connection with XMEM, it will show the error message because APCALL only accepts 8 maximum 32-bit native size of variables.
