Basic example is provided to demonstrate how to use the hls_tools

1. Please follow the installation section to install required components.


2. Configure the Xilinx Vitis path

```console
cd tutorial_example
cd hls_tools_script
```

Please edit $xilinx_vitis in ./run.sh to point to Vitis HLS program
```console
xilinx_vitis=/mnt/d/Xilinx/Vitis_HLS/2023.2/bin/vitis_hls
```

Ensure the script has executable permission
```
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

3. Synthesis HLS functions
To synthesis all HLS functions, type:
```console
./run.sh xhls all
```

To synthesis individual function, for example, vector_add, type:
```console
./run.sh xhls vector_add
```


4. (Optional) Capture the test data
The default is to run the linux/run.sh script and capture the input/output argument of vector_add 1000 times
``` console
./run.sh capture vector_add
```

You can customize the capture times by type:
```console
./run.sh capture 10 vector_add
```

5. (Optional) Run the C simulation of the HLS function
```console
./run.sh csim vector_add
```

6. (Optional) Run the co-simulation of the HLS function
```console
./run.sh cosim vector_add
```

7. (Optional) Run the co-simulation with the waveform generated by the HLS function
```console
./run.sh cosimwave vector_add
```

8. Link up the HLS functions and generate the relevant systemVerilog testbench by tying:
```console
./run.sh xgen all
```

Relevant verilog files will be generated under the autonet/export/simple_example directory
The hls_apcall.cpp will also be updated in the simple_example project, which served as the hardware function call interface that can be checked on the RISC-V simulator (asim)

9. Run on riscv simulator (asim)
```console
cd ../build/riscv-sim
source ./make-Makefiles.sh
source ./run.sh
```
