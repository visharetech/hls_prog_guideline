## 6. HLS Arguments
XCACHE, DCACHE and APCALL arguments could be used to share the variable between RISC-V and these HLS functions.

### 6.1 XCACHE
Xcache is a shared application specific cache among different HLS functions and RISC-V. The number of banks, data width and capacity can be optimized to meet the bandwidth and storage requirement of different accelerators. Meanwhile, RISC software can still access XCACHE via C code. Access times can vary depending on the cache miss rate. Currently, the size of XCACHE is configured to limit at 256MB.

### 6.2 DCACHE
The DCACHE interface allows the HLS module to access the standard D-cache embedded in each RISC-V core. Access times can vary depending on the cache miss rate and are generally slower than those of the XCACHE variables.

### 6.3 APCALL argument
You can choose to pass the arguments using the APCALL argument. The significant limitations include: support for input type only, a maximum of 8 arguments and a maximum width of 32 bits in each argument. Generally, using the XCACHE region is a better way to share data between HLS and RISC-V.

### 6.4 Example:
```C
typedef struct {
    int x _ALIGN;
    int y _ALIGN;
}vector_2d;

typedef struct xmem_t{
    uint8_t xor_val8 _ALIGN;
    uint16_t xor_val16 _ALIGN;
    uint32_t xor_val32 _ALIGN;
    int arr_complete[5] _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_s1 _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_s2 _ALIGN;
    vector_2d vec_d1 _ALIGN;
    int tc_arr[2] _ALIGN;
    uint8_t no_p_arr[2] _ALIGN;
    uint8_t no_q_arr[2] _ALIGN;
    int arr_s1[10] _ALIGN;
    int arr_s2[10] _ALIGN;
    int arr_d1[10] _ALIGN;
    uint8_t pix_base[128*128] _ALIGN;
}xmem_t;
```

1. It is recommended to add the xm_ prefix to distinguish the variable from XCACHE and APCALL arguments
2. _ALIGN macro should be added to each variable
3. The _i and _o postfixes generated by the HLS function are ignored. In other words, vec_i, vec_o, vec are treated as the same variable

The argument not in the XCACHE will be treated as APCALL argument. Therefore, if the argument is declared as an array and is not declared in XCACHE, during connection with XCACHE, it will show the error message because APCALL only accepts 8 maximum 32-bit native size of variables.

Programming constraints
* Recommend to add the ‘xm_’ prefix to identify the XCACHE data member
* must add the _ALIGN macro to each variable declared inside the XCACHE data structure
* Cannot use the _i and _o suffix
* The number of function call arguments must be less than 8
* Does not support array of structures inside XCACHE

Performance optimization
* If an HLS function has multiple DCACHE arguments, the hardware can only access one DCACHE argument in each cycle and so it takes multiple cycles to access all arguments. Furthermore, frequent and high speed data cache access may pollute the cache data used by other software functions, resulting in increasing cache miss cycles experienced by RISC cores.
* An HLS function with multiple XCACHE arguments may access different xcache data in parallel if they are connected with different xcache banks, thus sustaining the high memory bandwidth for enabling high accelerator throughput
